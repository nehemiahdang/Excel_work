# Excel_Challenge
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.


Within Excel, used the following tools
-Functions, such as =AVERAGE(),=MEDIAN(),=VAR.P(), etc
-Pivot Tables
-Creating and understanding line charts
-Delimiting a column into 2
-Conditional Formatting
-Timestamp conversion to date
-Using COUNTIF() to set up certain conditions to count specific set of numbers
